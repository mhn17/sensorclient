SensorClient
==========

Description
-----------
The SensorClient is a client for displaying data from sensor nodes (see [SensorNode](https://github.com/mhn17/sensornode "SensorNode")), which is collected by the [sensor server app](https://github.com/mhn17/sensorserver "SensorServer").

**Note:** The client is still in preliminary version, it is not yet connecting to the sensor server and displays only dummy images.
